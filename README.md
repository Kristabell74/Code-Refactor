# Code-Refactor

## Description

    In this project the goal was to make a functioning web page.  The code was cleaned and the structure changed  from div elements to semantic elements as much as possible making a logical structure that is easier to follow.  The images needed to be attached properly so that they would show up on the web properly.  The CSS folder was made more concise and has less repeats in the css.  The font was changed to a cleaner font on the body of the page and a border added to the imagesand to give the site a clean and precise look without taking away from the functionality of the site.

##Installation
In order to get the code onto Visual Studio Code I had to:

1. Pull the code from Git Hub and put the code on Visual Studio.
2. Put the code in its own file and name the file.
3. Make sure that the html was on the outside of the file with the pictures and css in the file.
4. Make a git hub repository for the work
5. Do and initial Push the work into the repository
6. Work on the code in visual studio code.
7. Push the finished work back into GitHub
8. Get the codes and turn in the work.
